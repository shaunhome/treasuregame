# Treasure Hunt Game

Welcome to the Treasure Hunt Game, implemented in Python!

## Overview
This project is a text-based game where players embark on a treasure hunt adventure on a grid-based board. Players can guess positions or entire phrases to find the hidden treasure while avoiding strikes. The game features interactive gameplay, admin mode for testing, and a dynamic display of the game board.

## Features
- **Grid-Based Treasure Hunt**: Navigate a grid to find the hidden treasure by guessing positions or entire phrases.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players interact with the game through intuitive input prompts and feedback.
- **Admin Mode**: Optional mode to reveal the treasure location for testing purposes.
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation ensures valid user inputs and prevents unexpected errors.
- **Scoring System**: Track the number of attempts taken to find the treasure and displays this in highscores.

## Coding Practices
- **Modular Design**: Organized into separate modules for game logic, input handling, board display, and admin functions.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation to handle boundary conditions, user input errors, and game logic constraints.
- **Grid Management**: Efficient management of player positions and treasure location on the game board.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides clear instructions and prompts for a user-friendly gaming experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for game implementation.
- **ASCII Art**: Visual representation of the game board and elements within the console.
- **GitHub**: Version control and project management.
